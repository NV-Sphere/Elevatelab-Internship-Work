TASK 08: WINDSCRIBE VPN RESEARCH LOG

1. IP AND LATENCY COMPARISON 
ORIGINAL CONNECTION:
  Location: India - Nashik / Gwalior
  Original IP: [REDACTED for Confidentiality - 106.222.X.X]
  Average Latency (Ping OFF): 33.8 ms

VPN CONNECTION:
  Server Location: United States - Atlanta/Dallas
  VPN Assigned IP: 23.94.48.123
  Average Latency (Ping ON): 280.8 ms
  Conclusion: VPN adds significant latency (approx. 247ms) due to encryption overhead and physical distance, validating the secure tunnel.

2. ENCRYPTION & PRIVACY FEATURES
A. ENCRYPTION STANDARDS:
   Windscribe uses industry-leading encryption protocols, including WireGuard (ChaCha20 for symmetric encryption) and OpenVPN (AES-256-GCM cipher with SHA512 auth).
   Support is also provided for Perfect Forward Secrecy.

B. NO-LOGS POLICY:
   Windscribe maintains a strict No-Logs Policy. They do not store connection logs, IP timestamps, or session logs that can personally identify a user.
   They have complied with **zero** law enforcement requests due to lack of relevant data.

C. JURISDICTION:
   The company operates out of Canada, providing a strong legal system that does not mandate that VPN providers log user activity.

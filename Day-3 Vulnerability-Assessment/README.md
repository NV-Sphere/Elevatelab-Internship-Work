# üéØDay 03 Task: Basic PC Vulnerability Assessment

## Date: 24 October 2025

### The Objective
The goal was to perform an introductory, unauthenticated vulnerability assessment on the local Windows machine to identify common risks and research proactive mitigation strategies, utilizing a professional-grade
free tool.

## Execution Summary
| Detail | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tool Used | Nessus Essentials (Tenable) | Chosen as the stable alternative to OpenVAS (GVM). |
| Operating System | Windows Host (Target) | Scan was launched from Windows itself. |
| Target IP | 192.168.X.X | IP was sanitized (blurred) in all proofs for security. |
| Scan Template | Basic Network Scan | Policy: CVSS v3.0 |
| Time Taken | 8 minutes | Scan completed quickly due to the efficient "Basic Network Scan" policy. |
| Total Findings | 26 Vulnerabilities | This included Critical, High, Medium, Low, and informational findings. |

## Vulnerability Findings: Analysis of Top 3 Risks

The scan identified 26 potential issues on the local host. The following table details the three most critical or actionable vulnerabilities found, along with their necessary fixes.

### Identified High-Risk Issues

| Severity | Issue Found | Risk & Impact Analysis | Fix/Remediation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Medium (5.3) | SMB Signing Not Required | This allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack and potentially tamper with data being sent over the network to the Windows host. | Enable SMB 
Message Signing for client and server communication via Windows Group Policy or Registry settings. |
| Medium | SSL/TLS Protocol Vulnerabilities | The system is likely configured to accept outdated or weak protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0/1.1). Attackers can exploit these old protocols to decrypt secure communications.
| Configure Windows to disable all older protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) and enforce the use of TLS 1.2 or 1.3 across all services. |
| Medium | Multiple Outdated Applications | Scanner detected software (e.g., outdated browsers, or third-party utilities) with publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs), providing easy remote access points for 
malware. | Immediately update all listed third-party software to the latest stable versions, or uninstall any applications that are no longer in use. |

----

## Mitigation Research (Proactive Steps)

| Vulnerability Category | General Fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| Missing Patches (OS) | Ensure Windows Update is set to Automatic and apply any critical Cumulative Updates immediately. |
| General Exposure | Uninstall all software and services that are not strictly necessary for the machine's operation (Principle of Least Functionality). |

### Professional Data Handling Note

For Security: All identifying information, including the local IP address (192.168.X.X) in the screenshots and the HTML raw report file, has been sanitized (blurred/replaced) to adhere to confidentiality best
practices for public disclosure.

## ‚ùì Interview Questions:

### 1. What is vulnerability scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is an automated, non-intrusive process that uses specialized tools (like Nessus or OpenVAS) to identify, catalogue, and report known security weaknesses or misconfigurations
present in a system or network. It provides a baseline view of potential risks.

### 2. Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?
| Feature | Vulnerability Scanning | Penetration Testing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goal | Identify known flaws and report them. | Exploit flaws to prove real-world risk and measure impact. |
| Method | Automated, comprehensive. | Manual, targeted, and deep. |

### 3. What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?
Common PC vulnerabilities include outdated software (Ex - old browsers or Java versions), missing operating system updates, misconfigured firewall rules, and weak passwords being used for privileged accounts.

### 4. How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?
Scanners detect vulnerabilities by comparing information gathered from the target (like software version numbers and configuration settings) against a vast internal database of known flaws (NVTs/plugins).
If the target's version matches a version with a known bug, the scanner flags it as a vulnerability.

### 5. What is CVSS?
CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a free, open industry standard for assigning a severity score (0 to 10) to a vulnerability. It helps security teams quantify and communicate the impact and 
exploitability of a flaw so they can prioritise fixes.

### 6. How often should vulnerability scans be performed?
Vulnerability scans should ideally be performed monthly or quarterly as a minimum baseline. However, they should always be run immediately after any major change to the network or installation of a critical 
or a new service.

### 7. What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?
A false positive occurs when the scanner flags a potential security flaw that is not actually a vulnerability. This usually happens because the scanner made an incorrect guess based on limited external 
information.

### 8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?
Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on their risk assessment score, which usually combines:
1. CVSS Score (Severity): How bad is the flaw (Critical/High/Medium)?
2. Exploitability: Is the flaw easy to use in an attack?
3. Asset Value: How important is the affected system?
